Python Flask

Flask is a (Sinatra-like e.g. clone of Ruby's implementation) micro web application framework written in Python and based on

the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. It is BSD licensed. 

As of 2015, the latest stable version of Flask is 0.10.1.[2] Examples of applications that make use of the Flask framework are

Pinterest,[3] LinkedIn,[4] as well as the community web page for Flask itself.[5] 

Flask is called a micro framework because it does not presume or force a developer to use a particular tool or library.[6] It has

no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide

common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in

Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication

technologies and several common framework related tools. 

Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo[8] which is an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.

According to Armin, "It came out of an April Fool's joke but proved popular enough to make into a serious application in its

own right."[9][10][11] Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine, both of them Pocoo projects

that were created when Ronacher and Georg Brandl were building a bulletin board system written in Python.[12] 

Despite the lack of a major release, Flask has become extremely popular among Python enthusiasts.
