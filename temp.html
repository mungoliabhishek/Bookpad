<html><pre>Python Flask</pre><pre></pre><pre>Flask is a (Sinatra-like e.g. clone of Ruby's implementation) micro web application framework written in Python and based on</pre><pre></pre><pre>the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. It is BSD licensed. </pre><pre></pre><pre>As of 2015, the latest stable version of Flask is 0.10.1.[2] Examples of applications that make use of the Flask framework are</pre><pre></pre><pre>Pinterest,[3] LinkedIn,[4] as well as the community web page for Flask itself.[5] </pre><pre></pre><pre>Flask is called a micro framework because it does not presume or force a developer to use a particular tool or library.[6] It has</pre><pre></pre><pre>no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide</pre><pre></pre><pre>common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in</pre><pre></pre><pre>Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication</pre><pre></pre><pre>technologies and several common framework related tools. </pre><pre></pre><pre>Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo[8] which is an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.</pre><pre></pre><pre>According to Armin, "It came out of an April Fool's joke but proved popular enough to make into a serious application in its</pre><pre></pre><pre>own right."[9][10][11] Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine, both of them Pocoo projects</pre><pre></pre><pre>that were created when Ronacher and Georg Brandl were building a bulletin board system written in Python.[12] </pre><pre></pre><pre>Despite the lack of a major release, Flask has become extremely popular among Python enthusiasts. </pre><pre></pre><pre>Features </pre><pre></pre><pre>Contains development server and debugger </pre><pre></pre><pre>Integrated support for unit testing </pre><pre></pre><pre>RESTful request dispatching </pre><pre></pre><pre>Uses Jinja2 templating </pre><pre></pre><pre>Support for secure cookies (client side sessions) </pre><pre></pre><pre>100% WSGI 1.0 compliant </pre><pre></pre><pre>Unicode-based </pre><pre></pre><pre>Extensive documentation </pre><pre></pre><pre>Google App Engine compatibility Extensions available to enhance features desired</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre></html>
